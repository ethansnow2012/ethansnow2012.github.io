This is a blog system temlpate that built fully with reactive programming paradigm in React. And the front-end is decoupled well with the backend so that anyone should have easy time implementing it with one's back-end with just one endpoint for data and one member system(I am using firebase for prices).

## Spec
Front-end Host: github page(easy to a change to your own)

Back-end Host: firebase(easy to a change to your own)

## Prerequisite

In root dir: .env.local
```
REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=local
```
In root dir: .env.production
```
REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=github_page
```
